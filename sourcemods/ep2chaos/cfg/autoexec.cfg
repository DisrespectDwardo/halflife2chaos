//Changes made to this file need a full game restart to take effect.



chaos 1 //1 turns on chaos by default.
//You can have as many active effects as you want, but only 5 can be shown on screen.
chaos_effect_interval 20 //Time between each effect
chaos_effect_time 80 //Standard effect length
gl_clear 1 //Some effects like "Where Are The Objects?" can cause rapid flashing if both gl_clear and VSync are off. If you don't suffer from photosensitivity issues, or you have VSync on, you can turn this off for a performance boost and to get the classic "hall of mirrors" void effect.
chaos_instant_off 0 //1 instantly removes effects when chaos is 0
chaos_strike_max 3 //If an effect causes the player to die too many times, it will be aborted.

//All below are multipliers of length for individual effects. For example if chaos_effect_time is 90 and a multiplier is 0.666, the length of an effect will be 60 seconds.
//The desired number for a multiplier is the desired time divided by chaos_effect_time.
//Non-continuous effects like "Give All Weapons" are not affected.

//1 (80 seconds)
//0.75 (60 seconds)
